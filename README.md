## DQN Learning
**Author: Moritz**

This project leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning to develop a trading strategy. The DQN algorithm is a reinforcement learning technique that helps in making sequential decisions. The primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards in trading scenarios.

### Features
- Implementation of DQN algorithm
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Performance analysis of trading strategy

## Semantic Analysis
**Author: Matthias**

The Semantic Analysis project involves analyzing financial texts to extract meaningful insights. This includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and other natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and categorize financial news and reports.

### Features
- Sentiment analysis of financial texts
- Topic modeling
- Text classification

## Google Trends
**Author: Yannick**

This project explores the use of Google Trends data to predict market movements. By analyzing search trends, the project aims to find correlations between search volume and financial market indicators.

### Features
- Data extraction from Google Trends
- Correlation analysis with financial markets
- Predictive modeling using trend data
