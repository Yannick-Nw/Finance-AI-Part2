# Finance Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects focusing on finance, each contributed by a different author. The projects are as follows:

## Table of Contents
1. [DQN Learning](#dqn-learning)
2. [Semantic Analysis](#semantic-analysis)
3. [Google Trends](#google-trends)

## DQN Learning
**Author: Moritz Schaller**

This project leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning to develop a trading strategy. The DQN algorithm is a reinforcement learning technique that helps in making sequential decisions. The primary goal is to maximize cumulative rewards in trading scenarios.

### Features
- Implementation of DQN algorithm
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Performance analysis of trading strategy

## Semantic Analysis
**Author: Matthias Pleyer**

The Semantic Analysis project involves analyzing financial texts to extract meaningful insights. This includes sentiment analysis and other natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret and categorize financial news and reports.

### Features
- Sentiment analysis of financial texts
- Assigning negative values to bad news and positive values to good news
- Data scraping, evaluation, and testing of the analysis

## Google Trends
**Author: Yannick Nwankwo**

This project explores the use of Google Trends data to predict market movements. By analyzing search trends, the project aims to find correlations between search volume and financial market indicators.

### Features
- Data extraction from Google Trends
- Correlation analysis with financial markets
- Predictive modeling using trend data
